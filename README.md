## Spicy
Build a form such that the user can input the strings only six times. On the sixth word, a RESET button will appear which will clear the board of words.

## Dangerous
Build Wordle where there is a set constant word, and for each guess (five-letter word), a report of which letter is in the right place (colored green), and which letter is there but not in the right place (colored yellow) is made for the display. If all the letters are green, then stop allowing any more inputs and show the RESET button. Screenshot your results and send it in.
